    <h2 class="nobreak">Use of Tobacco among North American Indians</h2>
  </div>

  <p>Tobacco has been one of the most important gifts from the New World
    to the Old. In spite of the attempts of various authors to prove its
    Old World origin there can be no doubt that it was introduced into
    both Europe and Africa from America. Most species of <i>Nicotiana</i>
    are native to the New World, and there are only a few species which
    are undoubtedly extra-American. The custom of smoking is also
    characteristic of America. It was thoroughly established throughout
    eastern North and South America at the time of the discovery; and
    the early explorers, from Columbus on, speak of it as a strange and
    novel practice which they often find it hard to describe. It played
    an important part in many religious ceremonies, and the beliefs and
    observances connected with it are in themselves proof of its antiquity.
    Hundreds of pipes have been found in the pre-Columbian mounds and
    village sites of the eastern United States and, although these remains
    cannot be dated, some of them must be of considerable age. In the
    southwestern United States the Basket Makers, an ancient people whose
    remains are found below those of the prehistoric Cliff Dwellers, were
    smoking pipes at a time which could not have been much later than the
    beginning of our era.</p>

  <p>At the time of the discovery of America, tobacco was in use over the
    greater part of the continent. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span> was not used in the sub-Arctic
    regions of North America or in the extreme southern part of Southern
    America. On the west coast of South America and in the Andean highlands
    it was replaced by another narcotic, coca (<i>Erythroxylum coca</i>),
    from which the modern drug cocaine is extracted. The coca leaves were
    dried and chewed with powdered lime. Tobacco was smoked throughout most
    of its range, but the tribes of the northwest coast of North America
    mixed it with shell lime and made it into small pellets which were
    allowed to dissolve in the mouth. The tribes of Washington, Oregon and
    a great part of California used it in the same way, but also smoked it.
    Along the eastern side of the Andean highlands in South America tobacco
    was both smoked and chewed. The chewing tobacco was prepared like the
    Andean coca, and the idea was probably borrowed from coca chewing.</p>

  <p>Although Europeans learned the custom of smoking from the Indians and
    even copied the Indian smoking appliances rather closely, the modern
    American custom of tobacco chewing may not be of Indian origin. None of
    the North American Indians east of the Rocky Mountains chewed tobacco,
    and the only point at which South American tobacco chewing reached the
    Atlantic Coast was a small region in northern Colombia. Modern chewing
    tobacco lacks the admixture of powdered lime, which was considered
    necessary by all Indian tobacco chewers and seems to have been an
    invention of the white frontiersmen. It is possible, however, that the
    idea of tobacco chewing was carried to the English colonies by the
    Spaniards, who may have learned it from the South American Indians.</p>

  <p>The North American Indians used at least nine species of
    <i>Nicotiana</i>, most of which were cultivated. <i>Nicotiana
    tabacum</i>, the species to which practically all the modern commercial
    tobaccos belong, was grown <span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>throughout Mexico, the West Indies,
    and in northern and eastern South America. It was unknown north of
    Mexico until its introduction into Virginia by the English colonists.
    <i>Nicotiana rustica</i>, a much hardier species with a yellow flower,
    was grown by the Indians of the eastern United States and Canada as far
    west as the great plains and as far north as agriculture was possible.
    It was the first tobacco grown in Virginia for the European trade, but
    was soon supplanted there by <i>N. tabacum</i>. Small patches of it are
    still cultivated by some of the Central Algonquian tribes who use it in
    their ceremonies. <i>N. attenuata</i> was used over a larger area than
    any other species. It is found in its natural state in the southwestern
    United States and southern plains, and as a cultivated plant extends
    northward into western Canada and British Columbia. It was also
    cultivated on the lower Colorado, but the typical Pueblo tribes do not
    seem to have raised it. <i>N. multivalvis</i> was grown in Washington
    and Oregon, as well as by the Crow, who lived on the western edge of
    the plains. A related species (<i>N. quadrivalvis</i>) was grown by the
    settled tribes along the Missouri river. Still another species (<i>N.
      biglovii</i>) was used by the California tribes, and is known to have
    been cultivated by the Hupa. The three last-named species are rather
    closely related; it seems probable that <i>N. multivalvis</i> and <i>N.
    quadrivalvis</i> were brought into the plains area from the west,
    displacing <i>N. attenuata</i>.</p>

  <p>There is very little information available on the aboriginal methods of
    tobacco culture in the eastern United States. Early writers say that it
    was not grown with other crops, as it was believed to be injurious to
    them, and was usually cultivated by men. Mr. Milford Chandler informs
    me that the Cayuga, in New York State, had permanent tobacco beds in
    which the plant was grown year after year. These beds were lightly
    manured from time to time, but were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span> cultivated, and the plants
    were left to propagate themselves. The leaves were gathered, but the
    stems, with the seed pods, were left standing in the patch. The Seneca,
    another tribe of the Iroquois confederacy, simply scattered the seeds
    on the ground and had a religious prohibition against cultivating the
    plant. Mr. Alanson Skinner informs me that the Kickapoo and Potawatomi
    made large brush piles fifty or more feet long and ten or twelve feet
    wide which they fired about the middle of June. When the ashes were
    cold, the ground was hoed up, mixed with the ashes, and planted with
    tobacco and pumpkins. The tobacco gardens were made in the woods,
    remote from the villages, and were surrounded by brush fences. The
    Sauk also planted their tobacco in the ashes of brush-fires, but
    did not break the ground or cultivate the crop. In some cases they
    simply threw a handful of seeds on the ground near the lodge. The
    Kickapoo, Potawatomi and Sauk all gathered the leaves of the plant in
    late August. They spread them on hides or blankets, and when they had
    wilted, rolled them like tea-leaves. When dry, the leaves were crushed.
    The reason assigned for the rolling was that leaves treated in this way
    did not crush to fine powder like those that had been dried flat. Most
    of the eastern tribes grew only enough tobacco for their own needs,
    but one, the Tionontati, raised large quantities of it for export and,
    on this account, were called Tobacco People (Nation de Petun) by the
    French.</p>

  <p>The best published account of aboriginal tobacco-culture is that given
    to G. L. Wilson by Buffalobird-woman, an old member of the Hidatsa
    tribe. The Hidatsa raised a different species of tobacco from the
    eastern Indians (<i>N. quadrivalvis</i>), and their methods were
    somewhat different. She says, “The old men of the tribe who smoked each
    had a tobacco garden planted not very far away from our corn-fields,
    but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span> never in the same plot with one. Tobacco gardens were planted
    apart, because the tobacco plants have a strong smell which affects
    the corn; if tobacco is planted near the corn, the growing corn-stalks
    turn yellow, and the corn is not so good. Tobacco seed was planted at
    the same time sunflower seed was planted (as early in April as the
    soil could be worked). The owner took a hoe and made soft every foot
    of the tobacco garden; and with a rake he made the loosened soil level
    and smooth. He marked the ground with a stick into rows about eighteen
    inches apart, and sowed the seed very thickly in the row. He covered
    the newly sowed soil very lightly with earth which he raked with his
    hand. When rain came and warmth, the seed sprouted. The plants came up
    thickly so that they had to be thinned out. The owner of the garden
    would weed out the weak plants, leaving only the stronger standing. The
    earth about each plant was hilled up with a buffalo rib into a little
    hill like a corn hill. A very old man, I remember, used a big buffalo
    rib, sharpened on the edge, to work the soil and cultivate his tobacco.
    He caught the rib by both ends with the edge downward; and stooping
    over, he scraped the soil toward him, now and then raising the rib
    up and loosening the earth with the point at one end. He knelt as he
    worked.</p>

  <p>“Tobacco plants began to blossom about the middle of June; and picking
    then began. Tobacco was gathered in two harvests. The first harvest
    was these blossoms, which we reckoned the best part of the plant
    for smoking. Blossoms were picked regularly every fourth day. If we
    neglected to pick them until the fifth day, the blossoms would begin
    to seed. Only the green part of the blossom was kept. When we fetched
    the blossoms home to the lodge, my father would spread a dry hide on
    the floor in front of his sacred objects and spread the blossoms on the
    hide to dry.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span> The smoke hole of the lodge, being rather large, would
    let through quite a strong sunbeam, and the drying blossoms were kept
    directly in the beam.</p>

  <p>“When the blossoms had quite dried, my father fetched them over near
    the fireplace and took a piece of buffalo fat, thrust it on the end of
    a stick and roasted it slowly over the coals. He touched it lightly
    here and there to the piled up blossoms, so as to oil them slightly,
    but not too much. Now and then he would gently stir the pile of
    blossoms with a little stick, so that the whole mass might be oiled
    equally. When my father wanted to smoke these dried blossoms, he
    chopped them fine with a knife, a pipeful at a time. The blossoms were
    always dried in the lodge: If dried without, the sun and air took away
    their strength.</p>

  <p>“About harvest time, just before frost came, the rest of the plants
    were gathered. He dried the plants in the lodge. For this he took
    sticks, about fifteen inches long, and thrust them over the beam
    between two of the exterior supporting posts, so that the sticks
    pointed a little upwards. On each of these sticks he hung two or three
    tobacco plants by thrusting the plants, root up, upon the stick, but
    without tying them. When the tobacco plants were quite dry, the leaves
    readily fell off. It was the stems that furnished most of the smoking.
    They were treated like the blossoms, with buffalo fat. We did not treat
    tobacco with buffalo fat except as needed for use, and to be put into
    the tobacco pouch ready for smoking.</p>

  <p>“Before putting the tobacco away in the cache pit, my father was
    careful to put aside seed for the next year’s planting. He gathered the
    black seeds into a small bundle about as big as a baby’s fist, wrapping
    them in a piece of soft skin which he tied with a string. He made two
    or three of these bundles and tied them to the top of his bed, or to a
    post nearby, where there was no danger of their being disturbed.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

  <p>The Blackfoot and Crow, nomadic tribes of the western Plains who raised
    no food crops, cultivated small patches of tobacco for ceremonial use.
    The ground was cleared of weeds and grass, and the seed planted in
    holes about two inches deep, made with a pointed stick. The gardens
    were weeded from time to time, but do not seem to have been regularly
    cultivated. In both tribes tobacco culture was attended by elaborate
    ceremonies. Among the Crow it was in the hands of a society which
    also played an important part in the social life of the tribe. The
    right to plant tobacco was considered a special privilege which could
    be obtained only through a revelation from some supernatural being
    or through adoption by a person who had received such a revelation.
    The adopted person could, in turn, adopt others. Any person might
    receive such a revelation, and the society was composed of a number
    of divisions or chapters which derived their right to plant from
    different revelations and differed in their songs and in details of
    their ceremonies. Within the chapter there were certain rights, such
    as that of mixing seed before planting, which could only be acquired
    by purchase. Both men and women were eligible to membership, and the
    society held assemblages for dancing throughout the year.</p>

  <p>Some of the tribes west of the Rocky Mountains also cultivated tobacco,
    although there is little information on their methods. On the Columbia
    River and in northern California a stump or fallen log was burned, and
    the tobacco seed scattered in the ashes.</p>

  <p>Most of the North American Indians mixed their tobacco with other herbs
    before smoking it. Among the more northern tribes, especially those who
    did not raise tobacco themselves, this was done partly through motives
    of economy, but the mixture was also designed to improve the flavor,
    as in our own commercial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span> blends. The favorite smoke of the tribes of
    the eastern United States and Canada was called kinnikinnick, from an
    Algonquian word meaning “that which is mixed.” Each tribe had its own
    formula for this mixture, but it usually consisted of tobacco, sumac
    leaves, and the inner bark of a species of dogwood. The bark and leaves
    of a number of other plants were sometimes added or substituted. A
    little oil was usually added to the mixture to bind the dust, which
    would otherwise irritate the smoker’s throat and clog the pipe.
    Kinnikinnick was milder than pure tobacco, and was preferred by most
    Indians and by many white hunters and settlers. The Pueblo Indians of
    the Southwest smoked various mixtures of tobacco and herbs in their
    religious ceremonies. The greatest care was used in compounding these
    ceremonial mixtures, and the plants were valued largely according to
    the distance from which they came. The California Indians diluted their
    tobacco with manzanita leaves or mixed it with Jamestown weed, itself a
    powerful narcotic. The choicest smoking mixture of the ancient Mexicans
    was made from tobacco and the gum of the liquidambar tree.</p>

  <p>Three main methods of smoking were used by the American aborigines.
    The natives of northern and central South America and the West
    Indies were cigar smokers. The Central Americans and Mexicans were
    predominantly cigarette smokers, although some of the ancient Mexicans
    also used pipes. The North American Indians, with the exception of the
    Pueblo tribes of the Southwest, were exclusively pipe-smokers. The
    distribution of these three methods in America has strongly influenced
    European smoking customs. The Mediterranean nations, who learned the
    use of tobacco from cigar and cigarette using Indians, still prefer
    to smoke it in these forms. The English, who came in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span> contact with
    the pipe-smoking Indians of the eastern United States are still
    predominantly pipe-smokers. The custom of cigarette-smoking did not
    become general in northern Europe and the United States until quite
    recent times, and the vigorous opposition which it has met here seems
    to be due quite as much to its novelty as to any proved injurious
    effects.</p>

  <p>Aboriginal cigars were practically identical with those now in use and
    were smoked in the same way.</p>

  <p>The aboriginal cigarette was made with a corn-husk wrapper and
    contained much less tobacco than the modern commercial variety.
    It is still in use throughout most of Mexico and Central America
    and among the Pueblo Indians of the southwestern United States.
    Archæological finds prove that the southwestern tribes smoked pipes
    or reed cigarettes in ancient times, and the corn-husk cigarette may
    have been introduced from Mexico during the early historic period.
    In recent times the spread of the Peyote cult, which originated in
    the southwestern Plains, has carried the corn-husk cigarette to many
    northern tribes who were unfamiliar with it even a generation ago. The
    Mexicans and Pueblo Indians also smoked reed cigarettes in ancient
    times, and the Hopi form may be taken as typical. It consisted of a
    small reed, not over two and a half inches long, packed with powdered
    tobacco. A band of some fabric was usually bound around the reed,
    leaving a flap hanging down by which it was held. Hundreds of the
    charred butts of such cigarettes have been found in the prehistoric
    ruins of the Southwest, but they are lacking in the lower archæological
    levels, and the earliest inhabitants of the region were probably pipe
    and not cigarette smokers.</p>

  <p>The Dakota say that they did not use pipes in ancient times, but smoked
    their tobacco in a hole in the ground. A similar method was used by
    the Cree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span> as a makeshift. Hind says, “I asked the Indian what he
    would do for a smoke until he had finished the new pipe. He arose and
    walking to the edge of the swamp cut four reeds, and joined some pieces
    together. After he had made a hole through the joints, he gently pushed
    one extremity in a slanting direction into the earth, which he had
    previously made firm by pressure with his foot. He then cut out a small
    hole in the clay, above the extremity of the reed, and molding it with
    his fingers, laughingly said: ‘Now give me tobacco, and I will show you
    how to smoke it.’ He then filled the hole with a mixture of tobacco and
    bearberry, placed a live coal on the top, and stretching himself at
    full length on the ground, with his chin supported by both hands, he
    took the reed between his lips and enjoyed a long smoke.”</p>

  <p>Indian pipes were of two main types,—straight pipes, in which the
    tobacco cavity and stem were in the same plane, as in a modern cigar
    holder, and elbow pipes, in which the bowl was inclined upward. The
    straight pipe was known throughout practically the whole of America
    north of Mexico, but was rare in the eastern United States. It was
    used to the practical exclusion of all other forms in the southwestern
    United States and on the Pacific coast. The elaborately decorated
    smoking tubes of the Mexicans, mentioned by early Spanish writers,
    may have been straight pipes, but many of them were probably cane
    cigarettes. The elbow pipe was the dominant form in the eastern United
    States and Great Plains, and also in eastern and southern South
    America. It was used to a limited extent by the prehistoric Mexicans
    and in southern California, and was not unknown in the Southwest. In
    historic times it has come into use in British Columbia and Alaska,
    regions in which tobacco was not originally smoked.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

  <p>The earliest pipes which can be even approximately dated are those of
    the Basket Makers, a people who lived in the southwestern United States
    in ancient times. Their remains are found below those of the Cliff
    Dwellers, and evidence along several lines indicates that they were
    living in the region by the beginning of the Christian era and had been
    absorbed or driven out by <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1000. A number of their pipes
    have been found. They are of the straight type and are usually quite
    small, short, and heavy, with separate stems about two inches long
    (<a href="#PLATE_II">Pl.&#160;II</a>, No.&#160;1). The bowls are made of stone, unbaked clay, or, rarely,
    wood; and the stems of wood or bird-bone. The stems are attached with
    pitch. Many of these pipes are heavily caked, and they were probably
    used for personal as well as ceremonial smoking. It is impossible
    to tell whether the Basket Makers used tobacco in these pipes and
    analyses of the cake have yielded only negative results. If they did
    use tobacco, it was probably the wild native species (<i>Nicotiana
    attenuata</i>).</p>

  <p>The Cliff Dwellers and ancient Pueblo tribes who succeeded the Basket
    Makers used straight pipes of a somewhat different type. They were
    usually longer and more slender than the Basket Maker pipes with
    somewhat thinner walls. The smaller examples, which were probably
    intended for personal use, seem to have had separate stems (<a href="#PLATE_II">Plate&#160;II</a>,
    No.&#160;2). Large tubular pipes, shaped like half a cigar, are also found,
    but were probably used only in ceremonial smoking. They are made of
    clay or soft stone and often show beautiful workmanship (<a href="#PLATE_II">Pl.&#160;II</a>, No.
    3). Roughly made clay pipes of this sort, popularly known as “cloud
    blowers,” are still used by the Hopi in their ceremonies.</p>

  <p>The California Indians, with the exception of the Diegueño, also used
    the straight pipe, and the form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span> is probably as ancient there as in
    the Southwest. There were various tribal and regional differences in
    the shape and material. Wooden pipes without separate stems were of
    nearly universal occurrence, and were probably the earliest form. In
    some regions they were carved and inlaid with abalone shell. Pipes
    of unbaked clay with wooden stems were used in a few localities (<a href="#PLATE_II">Pl.&#160;II</a>,
    No.&#160;4), but the finest California pipes were made of steatite
    or soapstone (<a href="#PLATE_II">Pl.&#160;II</a>, No.&#160;5). They were usually provided with short
    mouthpieces of wood or bone. The Hupa of northern California used a
    pipe with a small steatite bowl accurately fitted into a cavity in the
    end of a long tapering wooden stem (<a href="#PLATE_II">Pl.&#160;II</a>, No.&#160;6).</p>

  <p>Several of the tribes of the Great Plains used straight pipes in
    ancient times. These pipes were made from the leg bone of an antelope
    wrapped with sinew at the bowl end (<a href="#PLATE_III">Pl.&#160;III</a>, No.&#160;1). In some cases the
    whole pipe was covered with rawhide or membrane. The Arapaho say that
    they used this form exclusively in early times, and the sacred pipe of
    the tribe is straight with a black stone bowl and a long tubular wooden
    stem. A pipe of the same form, but with a red stone bowl, was used by
    the Cheyenne in their Sun Dance, and the Crow have made straight stone
    pipe bowls until quite recent times (<a href="#PLATE_V">Pl.&#160;V</a>, No.&#160;3).</p>

  <p>A number of straight pipes of stone and clay have been found in the
    eastern United States, but there seems to be no record of their use
    by the historic tribes. The examples shown (<a href="#PLATE_III">Pl.&#160;III</a>, Nos.&#160;2–3) are
    from Johnson County, Illinois. They are made from close-grained
    greenish brown steatite, a material soft enough to be easily worked
    with flint tools, but capable of taking a fine polish. The large size
    and excellent finish of these pipes indicates that they were intended
    for ceremonial rather than personal use. The bird pipe is eight and
    a quarter inches long, with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span> internal bowl diameter of one and
    a quarter inches, and is an unusually good example of aboriginal
    sculpture. The eye sockets are roughly finished, and were probably
    inlaid with some other material.</p>

  <p>Straight pipes are easier to make than elbow pipes, but have certain
    disadvantages. They have to be directed upward in smoking to keep the
    tobacco from falling out of the bowl, and the tobacco dust and juices
    are drawn down into the stem with results familiar to all smokers. To
    prevent this, many tribes are said to have put a pebble or pellet of
    clay in the bottom of the bowl before filling it. Even a slight angle
    between the bowl and stem is a great convenience to the smoker, and
    this improvement once hit upon, perhaps through faulty workmanship, the
    development of the elbow pipe was easy. Pipes from different parts of
    North America show all degrees of bowl inclination from the straight
    tube to a right angle, and there can be little doubt that the main
    evolution of the elbow pipe was along this line. In the Mississippi
    Valley and Great Plains there are, however, certain types of elbow pipe
    which could hardly have been developed in this way. In these the bowl
    rests upon a base which extends out for some distance in front of it.
    From various archæological finds it seems probable that these types
    were developed from pipes which had a corn-cob bowl pierced through the
    base with a reed stem.</p>

  <p>North American elbow pipes have never been satisfactorily classified,
    but about twenty types are distinguishable. Only the more important
    of these can be mentioned here. Most of the types show a more or
    less continuous geographical distribution, but there was no tribe or
    region in which all the pipes were of the same type. The Chippewa
    distinguished four types of pipe which were in simultaneous use among
    them. These were—(1) Women’s pipes, which were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span> small, with short
    stems and little decoration. (2) Men’s pipes for ordinary smoking,
    which were somewhat larger and better made than the women’s pipes, but
    were also small. (3) Personal pipes of famous warriors, which were
    larger than the ordinary pipes, with heavy decorated stems sometimes
    as much as five feet long. (4) Chief’s pipes and ceremonial pipes,
    which were large, with long stems like the warrior’s pipes, and were
    elaborately decorated. Even the pipes for ordinary smoking were highly
    valued and would often be carved and decorated in the owner’s spare
    time. Stone for pipe-making, and even finished pipes, seem to have been
    bartered from tribe to tribe in ancient times.</p>

  <p>The Indians made their pipes from many materials. Most of the
    prehistoric pipes are of stone or clay, but early records prove that
    wood, horn, and bone were also used by the tribes of the Atlantic Coast
    at the time of their first contact with Europeans. Almost all the
    pipes made of these perishable materials have been destroyed, but they
    were probably of the same types as the stone and clay pipes from this
    region. Clay pipes were in at least occasional use throughout the whole
    of North America east of the Great Plains, but the finest examples
    are found in the old Iroquois territory in New York State and Canada,
    and in the southeastern United States. Stone pipes are found from the
    Atlantic coast to the Rocky Mountains and seem to have been preferred
    by all those tribes among whom pottery making was poorly developed.</p>

  <p>Large numbers of Iroquoian clay pipes have been found in old cemeteries
    and village sites, and their form makes them easily distinguishable in
    collections. They are made of fine hard-burned clay and have a graceful
    trumpet shape, with rather long slender bowls and short stems (<a href="#PLATE_IV">Pl.&#160;IV</a>,
    No.&#160;3). The upper part of the bowl is often encircled by a band of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>incised designs or modeled into a human face or bird’s head. They
    were not provided with separate stems.  </p>

  </div>

  <p>Archæological finds on the Atlantic coast prove that the Indians of
    that region also used small clay pipes, although the early visitors
    only mention large pipes with excessively long stems. It seems probable
    that the larger forms were semi-ceremonial, like the warrior’s and
    chief’s pipes of the Chippewa, while the small pipes were used for
    individual smoking. Many of these small pipes resemble rather closely
    the early European trade pipes, and modern clay pipes and straight
    briers, but the type is unquestionably pre-European. It was probably
    the prototype from which modern European pipes were developed. Some of
    the ancient pipes were made in one piece, while others were evidently
    provided with separate stems, probably reeds. Identical forms were made
    in stone in this region.</p>

  <p>In the southeastern United States short clay pipes with reed or
    wooden stems seem to have been in common use. They were often rather
    elaborately decorated, with modeled figures of birds, clay pellets, or
    incised designs. This form of pipe is still in use among the Catawba,
    although many of their pipes show the influence of European models (<a href="#PLATE_IV">Pl.&#160;IV</a>,
    No.&#160;4).</p>

  <p>Pottery pipes with flaring bowls and slender stems, sometimes as much
    as eighteen inches long, are found in prehistoric Caddoan sites in
    Arkansas. The stems are excessively fragile, and as these pipes are
    usually found in the corners of graves, it seems probable that they
    were made for mortuary use rather than actual smoking. They are clearly
    imitations of a type which had a corn-cob bowl impaled on a reed stem.</p>

  <p>Stone pipes occur over a wider territory than pottery pipes and show
    a greater diversity of form. There are some regions in which the same
    shapes occur in both stone and pottery, but there are several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span> types of
    pipe which appear never to have been made of clay. Most of the stones
    used in pipe-making were quite soft, but a few pipes of quartzite and
    other hard rocks have been found. The material was carefully selected,
    and was usually obtained from regular quarries. In the eastern United
    States steatite, serpentine and slate were the stones most used. In the
    upper Mississippi valley and Great Plains the favorite material was
    catlinite, a fine-grained claystone soft enough to be easily worked
    with stone tools, but firm enough to take a high polish. Deposits of
    this material have been found in several states, and a local variety
    was used by the Ohio Mound Builders. The most famous catlinite quarries
    are in southeastern Minnesota and yield the highly prized red stone
    from which so many Plains Indian pipes are made. Here the catlinite
    occurs as a narrow layer, nowhere more than twenty inches thick,
    between strata of compact quartzite five to eight feet thick. To reach
    the catlinite it was necessary to break away the quartzite with stone
    mauls or shatter it by building large fires upon it and then dashing
    water on the heated stone. The old Indian workings extend for more than
    a mile along the face of the deposit, and the quarry must have been in
    use for several centuries. According to Indian traditions, the place
    was visited by many different tribes, who considered it common property
    and abstained from hostilities there. In historic times the Dakota
    considered it exclusively their property, and part of it was set aside
    for their use when they ceded their other lands in the vicinity. They
    still visit it occasionally to obtain stone for their pipes. White men
    have also worked the quarry, and in 1865 and 1866 over two thousand
    pipes of this material were made by the Northwestern Fur Company for
    their trade with the Indians.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

  <p>The finest aboriginal pipes are unquestionably the so-called monitor
    pipes found in the Ohio mounds. Many of these show such excellence
    of design and execution that early investigators doubted whether
    they could be the work of American Indians. They are made of soft
    stone or of fire clay, which was carved like stone, but never of
    pottery. The type is characterized by a long, broad, and very thin
    base from the center of which the bowl rises vertically. The base may
    be either flat or convex. The bowl is often made in the form of an
    animal or bird, and some of these effigies show artistic ability of
    a high order. Even when the style is impressionistic, the species is
    usually unmistakable. The significance of these carvings can only be
    conjectured, but so many species are shown that it seems probable that
    they represent the personal guardians of the pipes’ owners. None of the
    historic tribes used pipes of this type, and the finest examples are
    unquestionably pre-Columbian. One of the pipes illustrated (<a href="#PLATE_IV">Pl.&#160;IV</a>, No.&#160;1)
    is of typical monitor form, but has the bowl incised with designs
    representing bird’s heads. In the other (<a href="#PLATE_VI">Pl.&#160;IV</a>, No.&#160;2) the shape has
    been modified to suit the subject, a roseate spoonbill resting on the
    back of some large water animal, probably a mud puppy (<i>Necturus
    maculosus</i>).</p>

  <p>A number of large stone pipes have been found in the southeastern
    United States (<a href="#PLATE_III">Pl.&#160;III</a>, Nos.&#160;4–5). Some of these pipes weigh several
    pounds and, as they are everywhere associated with smaller forms of
    stone or clay, they were probably made for ceremonial use. They seem
    to have been provided with long, thick wooden stems. These heavy pipes
    are of several types, and are usually well made, but are inferior to
    the monitor pipes in design and execution. In Georgia, Alabama, and
    the lower Mississippi valley there is a very massive short type in
    which the bowl and stem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span> holes are conical and of nearly equal size
    and depth. These biconical pipes are often made in the form of human
    effigies or of highly conventionalized animals or birds.</p>

  <p>Early visitors to the north Atlantic Coast say that the Indians of
    that region used heavy carved pipes with stems three to six feet long.
    Large stone pipes are hardly ever found in this region, and even small
    carved pipes are extremely rare. It seems probable that these early
    forms either had quite small, plain bowls with heavy carved stems, or
    were made of wood or other perishable material. Holm says that the
    Pennsylvania Indians made their pipe bowls of horn, and several of the
    Algonquian tribes have made a considerable use of carved wooden pipes
    in historic times. Among many tribes the stems of ceremonial pipes were
    elaborately decorated, and were considered more important than the
    bowls.</p>

  <p>Plains Indian pipes are commoner in collections than those from any
    other region. The Blackfoot preferred pipes of black stone, with
    acorn-shaped bowls reminiscent of those in use among the Micmac and
    other northeastern Algonquian tribes (<a href="#PLATE_V">Pl.&#160;V</a>, No.&#160;4), but throughout
    most of the Plains the favorite pipe was made of Minnesota catlinite,
    and was of Sioux type (<a href="#PLATE_V">Pl.&#160;V</a>, Nos.&#160;6–8). This type is common in museums
    and private collections. It has a tubular bowl set vertically on a long
    base which projects beyond the bowl as a pointed spur. This projecting
    base is also found in the monitor pipes, and the two types may be
    remotely related. Pipes of the Sioux type have been made in great
    numbers by both whites and Indians, and many of those in collections
    were probably manufactured by whites. Either early white traders, or
    the tribes on the eastern edge of the Plains originated the practice of
    inlaying the bowls and bases with lead. The pipe was cut to nearly its
    final <span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>form, and a clay mold made. Deep grooves were then cut in the
    stone to receive the lead, and the pipe was returned to the mold, and
    the metal poured. The metal and stone were then rubbed down to a smooth
    surface. Valuable pipes which had been broken were sometimes repaired
    in this way.</p>

  <p>All Plains Indian pipes, with the exception of the straight bone pipes
    previously noted, were provided with long, heavy, wooden stems. Some
    tribes preferred tubular, others flat stems. In ancient times most of
    the long pipe stems were probably split lengthwise, the smoke passage
    excavated, and the two halves glued together. Some of the northern
    and western tribes used a solid tubular stem which they pierced by an
    ingenious method. They selected a young ash shoot which had a small
    pith cavity in the center and caught a wood-boring grub. They made a
    hole in one end of the shoot and inserted the grub, closing the opening
    behind it. The shoot was then hung over a fire, and the grub, following
    the pith as the line of least resistance, drilled a hole through the
    shaft from end to end. When it emerged, it was captured and returned
    to the place where it had been found with appropriate thanks. Split
    tubular stems are rather unsatisfactory, as the halves are liable to
    warp and separate. The broad, flat pipe-stem was probably invented to
    give a wider surface for the glue and hence a firmer joint. It reached
    its highest development among the Dakota, and they seem to have been
    the inventors of the “puzzle stem,” a broad, flat stem pierced with
    designs so that the smoke passage had to make several turns between
    the pipe-bowl and mouth-piece. Pipe stems were often decorated with
    elaborate wrappings which helped to hold the halves together.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

  <p>A peculiar form of pipe, which may be a variant of the Sioux type, is
    found in a limited area in the upper Mississippi valley. These pipes
    usually have bases with long projecting spurs, but the bowl is smaller
    than the stem hole and very low. It is surrounded by a broad, thin disk
    sometimes as much as three and a half inches across. Some of these
    “disk pipes” suggest the shallow-bowled pipes of the Asiatics, but the
    form is certainly prehistoric. Pipes of this type are rare, and were
    probably made for ceremonial use. One of the sacred pipes of the Omaha
    is of this sort.</p>

  <p>Although all the Mexican Indians were predominantly cigarette-smokers,
    ancient clay pipes of elbow type have been found in the valley of
    Mexico (<a href="#PLATE_IV">Pl.&#160;IV</a>, No.&#160;5). They are not mentioned by any of the early
    Spanish writers, but the specimens found are unquestionably of native
    workmanship, and are probably prehistoric. The commonest form has a
    bulb-shaped bowl and a rather thick stem flattened on the bottom, so
    that the pipe will stand upright. The occurrence of elbow pipes in a
    limited area, far from any other in which they were known, is difficult
    to account for. Some of these pipes resemble forms in use in the
    southeastern United States and lower Mississippi valley.</p>

  <p>Elbow pipes were also used on the Northwest Coast and in Alaska, but
    they were introduced into these regions after the discovery of America.
    The Alaskan Eskimo apparently learned the practice of smoking from the
    natives of Siberia, and their pipes are of Asiatic type, with very
    small bowls (<a href="#PLATE_VI">Pl.&#160;VI</a>, No.&#160;1). Their best pipes are made from walrus
    tusks, and are often elaborately etched. The tusk is usually split
    lengthwise and the halves joined in such a way that they can be taken
    apart to obtain the juice distilled in smoking. The juice was mixed
    with fungus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span> ashes for chewing or with the smoking tobacco. Poorly made
    pipes of Eskimo form were used by the Athapascan tribes of interior
    Alaska, who were taught to smoke by the Eskimo.</p>

  <p>The Indians of the Northwest Coast chewed tobacco in ancient times, but
    did not smoke it. The more northern tribes may have adopted smoking
    from Asia by way of the Eskimo, but their pipes show little resemblance
    to the Asiatic forms, and they probably learned the practice from white
    visitors. The natives of this region are expert carvers, and nearly all
    their pipes are decorated with figures of men or totemic animals. Wood
    is the favorite material (<a href="#PLATE_VI">Pl.&#160;VI</a>, No.&#160;2), but bone and antler are also
    used and some of the tribes make very elaborate pipes of black slate
    (<a href="#PLATE_VI">Pl.&#160;VI</a>, No.&#160;3). The slate pipes are much sought after by collectors,
    and many of them seem to have been made for sale rather than use.</p>

  <p>Pipes are mentioned among the goods given to the Indians in some of
    the earliest English land-purchases, and they were regularly carried
    by the white traders with the Indians. An English pipe-maker, Robert
    Cotton, came to Virginia in 1608. The earliest trade pipes were made
    of clay and seem to have been patterned after the small pipes used
    for personal smoking by the coast tribes. Those made in the various
    European countries showed minor differences, but were all of nearly the
    same form. The later trade pipes show an increasing diversity in shape
    and decoration, but the whites apparently did not attempt to make the
    larger ceremonial forms. The most important contribution on the part
    of the whites to the Indian tobacco complex was the tomahawk pipe.
    This implement had a pipe-bowl above and a blade below, and could be
    used either as a pipe or as a weapon. We do not know when or where it
    originated, but it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span> apparently did not come into general use in the
    English Colonies before 1750. All the European nations equipped their
    Indian allies with tomahawk pipes, and a number of types are recognized
    by collectors. The pipe-bowl was nearly always of acorn shape, like
    the pipe used by the northeastern Algonquians, but the blade varied
    considerably. In general, the English and early American tomahawks had
    straight-edged hatchet-blades, and the French ones had diamond-shaped
    blades, like spear-heads. Spanish tomahawks had flaring blades with
    curved edges, like mediæval battle-axes. There were a number of white
    tomahawk-makers whose work differed in minor details; and fine inlaid,
    chased, or inscribed tomahawks were sometimes made for presentation to
    important chiefs.</p>

  <p>An Indian warrior was rarely without his pipe and tobacco, and special
    tobacco-bags were used by all the tribes east of the Rocky Mountains.
    In early times, these bags were usually made from the skins of small
    animals taken off whole. The Eastern Woodland tribes used a rather
    small bag which was tied to the belt. The Plains tribes used a larger
    bag, often made from a fawn skin, in which they carried both the pipe
    and tobacco. In historic times the northern Plains Indians have used
    long, flat rectangular bags decorated with beads or porcupine quills,
    but this type apparently is not an ancient one (<a href="#PLATE_V">Pl.&#160;V</a>, No.&#160;10). Several
    of the Plains tribes also had special boards on which the tobacco was
    cut up and elaborate pipe tampers (<a href="#PLATE_V">Pl.&#160;V</a>, No.&#160;9). These accessories
    were used mainly in ceremonial smoking. In Pawnee ceremonies the
    pipe was always tamped with an arrow captured from the enemy. It was
    forbidden to pack it with the fingers, as the gods might think that the
    man who did so offered himself with the tobacco and take his life. The
    tribes of the Northwest Coast crushed their tobacco<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span> in mortars. These
    were usually made from whale vertebrae, and were often elaborately
    carved.</p>

  <p>Even if documentary evidence of the New World origin of tobacco were
    lacking, its importance in the religious and ceremonial life of the
    Indians would leave little doubt of the antiquity of its use among
    them. Among all the tribes east of the Rocky Mountains tobacco was the
    favorite offering to the supernatural powers, and among the Central
    Algonquians no ceremony could take place without it. As a sacrifice
    it might be burned as incense, cast into the air or on the ground, or
    buried. There were sacred places at which every visitor left a tobacco
    offering, and during storms it was thrown into lakes and rivers to
    appease the under-water powers. Smoking was indulged in on all solemn
    occasions, such as councils, and was a necessary part of most religious
    ceremonies. In such ceremonial smoking the methods of picking up,
    filling, and lighting the pipe were usually rigidly prescribed, and
    the first smoke was offered to the spirits. The methods of passing and
    holding the pipe were also prescribed and differed with the ceremony
    and even with the personal taboos of the smokers. In the religious
    ceremonies of the Hopi, the head chief was attended by an assistant
    of nearly equal rank, who ceremonially lighted the pipe, and with
    certain formalities and set words handed it to the chief, who blew the
    smoke to the world quarters and over the altar as a preliminary to his
    invocation.</p>

  <p>The so-called medicine-bundles, collections of sacred objects around
    which the religious life of many of the Central Algonquians and
    Plains Tribes centered, often contained pipes which were smoked in
    the ceremonies attending the opening of the bundle (<a href="#PLATE_V">Pl.&#160;V</a>, Nos.&#160;1–2).
    In some cases the pipe itself seems to have been the most important
    object, and the palladium of the Arapaho tribe is a straight pipe of
    black stone.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span> Among some of the eastern Siouan tribes each clan had its
    sacred pipe which was used at namings and other clan ceremonies. The
    stems of these pipes were covered with elaborate wrappings and other
    ornaments which symbolized the various supernatural powers invoked in
    the ceremonies, and the sanctity of the pipe lay in its stem rather
    than its bowl.</p>

  <p>The calumet, so often mentioned in early American records, was not a
    pipe, but an elaborately decorated shaft, pierced like a pipe stem,
    to which a pipe bowl was not necessarily attached. The name itself
    is not of Indian origin, but is a Norman-French word meaning a reed
    or tube. J. N. B. Hewitt says, “From the meager descriptions of the
    calumet and its uses it would seem that it has a ceremonially symbolic
    history independent of that of the pipe; and that when the pipe became
    an altar, by its employment for burning sacrificial tobacco to the
    gods, convenience and convention united the already highly symbolic
    calumet shafts and the sacrificial tobacco altar, the pipe bowl;
    hence it became one of the most profoundly sacred objects known to
    the Indians of northern America. As the colors and other adornments
    of the shaft represent symbolically various dominant gods of the
    Indian pantheon, it follows that the symbolism of the calumet and
    pipe represented a veritable executive council of the gods. Moreover,
    in some of the elaborate ceremonies in which it was necessary to
    portray this symbolism the employment of two shafts became necessary,
    because the one with its colors and accessory adornments represented
    the procreative male power and his aid, and was denominated the male,
    the fatherhood of nature; and the other with its colors and necessary
    adornments represented the reproductive female power and her aid, and
    was denominated the female, the motherhood of nature.</p>

  <p>“The calumet was employed by ambassadors and travelers as a passport;
    it was used in ceremonies designed to conciliate foreign and hostile
    nations and to conclude lasting peace; to ratify the alliance of
    friendly tribes; to secure favorable weather for journeys; to bring
    needed rain; and to attest contracts and treaties which could not
    be violated without incurring the wrath of the gods. The use of the
    calumet was inculcated by religious precept and example. A chant and a
    dance have become known as the chant and dance of the calumet; together
    they were employed as an invocation to one or more of the gods. By
    naming in the chant the souls of those against whom war must be waged,
    such persons were doomed to die at the hands of the person so naming
    them. The dance and chant were rather in honor of the calumet than with
    the calumet.</p>

  <p>“The Omaha and cognate names for this dance and chant signify ‘to make
    a sacred kinship,’ but not ‘to dance.’ This is a key to the esoteric
    significance of the use of the calumet. The one for whom the dance
    for the calumet was performed became thereby the adopted son of the
    performer. One might ask another to dance the Calumet dance for him, or
    one might offer to perform this dance for another, but in either case
    the offer or invitation could be declined.</p>

  <p>“Charlevoix (1721) says that if the calumet is offered and accepted it
    is the custom to smoke in the calumet, and the engagements contracted
    are held sacred and inviolable, in just so far as such human things
    are inviolable. The Indians profess that the violation of such an
    engagement never escapes just punishment. In the heat of battle, if
    an adversary offer the calumet to his opponent and he accept it, the
    weapons on both sides are at once laid down; but to accept or to
    refuse the offer of the calumet is optional.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span> There are calumets for
    various kinds of public engagements, and when such bargains are made an
    exchange of calumets is usual, in this manner rendering the contract or
    bargain sacred.</p>

  <p>“By smoking together in the calumet the contracting parties intend
    to invoke the sun and the other gods as witnesses of the mutual
    obligations assumed by the parties, and as a guaranty the one to the
    other that they shall be fulfilled. This is accomplished by blowing the
    smoke toward the sky, the four world quarters, and the earth, with a
    suitable invocation.</p>

  <p>“There were calumets for commerce and trade and for other social and
    political purposes; but the most important were those designed for war
    and those for peace and brotherhood. It was vitally necessary, however,
    that they should be distinguishable at once, lest through ignorance
    and inattention one should become the victim of treachery. The Indians
    in general chose not or dared not to violate openly the faith attested
    by the calumet, and sought to deceive an intended victim by the use
    of a false calumet of peace in an endeavor to make the victim in some
    measure responsible for the consequences. On one occasion a band of
    Sioux, seeking to destroy some Indians and their protectors, a French
    officer and his men, presented, in the guise of friendship, twelve
    calumets, apparently of peace; but the officer, who was versed in
    such matters and whose suspicion was aroused by the number offered,
    consulted an astute Indian attached to his force, who caused him to see
    that among the twelve one of the calumet shafts was not matted with
    hair like the others, and that on the shaft was graven the figure of a
    viper, coiled around it. The officer was made to understand that this
    was the sign of covert treachery, thus frustrating the intended Sioux
    plot.”</p>

  <p>The use of the calumet was almost universal in the Mississippi valley
    and among the Plains tribes, but in the Ohio and St. Lawrence valleys
    and southward its use is not so definitely shown. The symbolism and
    ritual of the calumet reached its highest development among the Pawnee
    and neighboring Siouan tribes and the concept probably originated in
    this region.</p>
